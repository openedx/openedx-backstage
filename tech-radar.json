This helps establish strong boundaries around these domains and ensures they remain loosely coupled.  The approach is the frontend version of a micro-service architecture.  In the Open edX platform, micro-frontends are purely frontend and contain no backend code.  MFEs communicate with backend services via RESTful APIs (generally), and share some foundational libraries like frontend-build, frontend-platform, and paragon.  A downside of this approach is that each MFE bundles its own third-party dependencies, so there is some code duplication and redundant assets as a user navigates around the site from MFE to MFE.  We've found the micro-frontend approach to have a very positive effect on developer velocity and our ability to continuously deploy our frontends.

This helps establish strong boundaries around these domains and ensures they remain loosely coupled.  The approach is the frontend version of a micro-service architecture.  In the Open edX platform, micro-frontends are purely frontend and contain no backend code.  MFEs communicate with backend services via RESTful APIs (generally), and share some foundational libraries like frontend-build, frontend-platform, and paragon.  A downside of this approach is that each MFE bundles its own third-party dependencies, so there is some code duplication and redundant assets as a user navigates around the site from MFE to MFE.  We've found the micro-frontend approach to have a very positive effect on developer velocity and our ability to continuously deploy our frontends.  We are in the process of replatforming all \"legacy\" frontends to be micro-frontends.",

While we are not using it today, we believe it can help us firm up our domain boundaries, allow teams to work more independently, and reduce bundle sizes by sharing common modules used by multiple MFEs.  It comes with some complexity around versioning of shared dependencies, however, which has prevented us from moving forward with adoption.  Because it has no ability to establish a security sandbox around code loaded from outside our trust domain, it has limited utility for extensibility.
